## What's new in v1.2

- **Live window previews:** Hover a running app to see its open windows in real time, click one to bring it forward.
- **Running apps you haven't pinned:** Apps currently open but not pinned show up on the dock now.
- **Customize your icons:** iOS-style color tint with 12 presets or pick your own color.
- **Drag to reorder:** Now you can rearrange your dock shortcuts right in the Settings list by dragging them around.
- **Vertical dock:** Arrange the dock vertically on either side of the screen.
- **Updates that keep your setup:** - Upgrading to a new version replaces the app but keeps your shortcuts and settings.
- **Long-awaited feature:** Now CTRL + D does NOT minimizes the Dock anymore. It remains on the Desktop.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How To Contribute
> Only for those who wish to contribute in the project's coding, none of this is required for you to do if you [just want to download it](https://github.com/arthurdeka/cedro-modern-dock/releases)
### Understand the project architecture:

The project follows a layered architecture:

- `CedroModernDock.Core`: Domain models, Application services, and i18n (portable, no OS deps)
- `CedroModernDock.Infrastructure.Windows`: Windows-specific adapters (Win32 interop, icon extraction, JSON persistence, registry auto-start, tray icon)
- `CedroModernDock`: Avalonia UI (dock view, settings window, view models, view locators)
- `CedroModernDock.Tests`: xUnit test suite

`App.axaml.cs` is responsible for composing these dependencies and injecting them into the view models.
